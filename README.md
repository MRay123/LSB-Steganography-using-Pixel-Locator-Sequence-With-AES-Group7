## Setup

First, clone the local repository using 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MRay123/LSB-Steganography-using-Pixel-Locator-Sequence-With-AES-Group7/tree/master
    ```

Then run the command

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will require the neccessary modules for this program.

## Using the program

Run the main. In the terminal, it will prompt for a message, then a password. It will then display the message that has been encoded. Afterwards, it will ask for the pls password.
In the actual paper, it would ask for the choice between encoding and decoding, but that choice isn't required here.
